Raygun4Net is a small library that can listen to all unhandled exceptions in your Android and iOS applications and send the details to your [Raygun.com](https://raygun.com/) account. This allows you to see issues in your application as soon as your users encounter them. Then you can debug and release a new bug-free version faster than ever before.

As you can see below, there is not much code required at all to integrate this Raygun provider into your application. Full documentation is provided when you install this component, and a step-by-step guide is available when you register an application on your [Raygun.com](https://raygun.com/) dashboard.

In the code below, attaching Crash Reporting and Pulse (Real User Monitoring) are each optional depending on which product(s) you're interested in using.

```csharp
using Mindscape.Raygun4Net;
...

// Place this code somewhere in the main entry point of your application.
// For Android, make sure to pass in the main entry activity to the AttachPulse method.
RaygunClient.Initialize("YOUR_APP_API_KEY").AttachCrashReporting().AttachPulse();
```
